# PHP Programming Logic Training with Claude AI 🤖

Daily practice log using Claude AI-generated problems to develop PHP programming problem-solving skills. This repository focuses on building the ability to read specifications, identify required processes, and construct logical PHP code solutions.

## 🎯 Learning Method
**Goal**: Master the skill of reading specifications and building logical PHP code solutions

**Approach**: I solve **3 Claude AI problems daily** targeting core programming concepts:
1. **Study Problem** - Learn new concepts with detailed explanation
2. **Practice Problem** - Reinforce understanding with similar challenges
3. **Challenge Problem** - Test independent problem-solving skills

**Why this approach?**: 
- Develops specification analysis skills
- Builds logical thinking for algorithm construction
- Improves PHP code implementation abilities
- Safe to document learning process publicly
