## üìä Summary
- **Theme**: Arrays
- **Problems Solved Independently**: 1/3
- **Understanding**: 93%

## Problem 1: Array Search Position
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A library system needs to locate books on the shelf. Each book has a unique reference number, and books are arranged in order on the shelf.
Given N book reference numbers in shelf order and a target reference number, find the position (1-indexed) of the target book.
If the book is not found, output -1.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5 250
100 200 250 300 400

Output:
3
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	list($n, $target) = [5, 250];
	$reference_nums = [100, 200, 250, 300, 400];

	$pos = array_search($target, $reference_nums);

	if ($pos !== false) {
	    echo $pos + 1;
	} else {
	    echo -1;
	}
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt the crucial difference between `if ($position)` and `if ($position !== false)` when using `array_search()`. The issue arises because `array_search()` returns the index (including 0), but in PHP, 0 evaluates to false in boolean context. Using strict comparison with `!== false` ensures proper detection of elements found at index 0.

## Problem 2: Conditional Filtering
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
An online shop needs to filter products based on customer preferences.
N products with their prices are given, along with a budget limit.
Output all product prices that are within the budget (less than or equal to the limit), in the order they appear.
If no products are within budget, output "NONE".
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
6 1500
1200 1800 900 1600 1400 800

Output:
1200 900 1400 800
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	list($amount, $budget) = [6, 1500];
	$prices = [1200, 1800, 900, 1600, 1400, 800];

	$affordable = array_filter($prices, function($price) use ($budget) {
	    return $price <= $budget;
	});

	if ($amount > 0) {
	    echo implode(' ', $affordable);
	} else {
	    echo 'NONE';
	}
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt when to use `array_filter()` for conditional data extraction. It's particularly useful when you need to filter an array based on specific criteria whilst preserving the original order. The callback function approach makes it much cleaner than writing manual foreach loops for filtering operations.

## Problem 3: Multi-Condition Analysis
**Understanding**: 80%

### Problem Description
```
A company's HR department needs to analyse employee working patterns.
N employees' daily working hours for a week are given. Analyse the data and output:

1. The number of employees who worked overtime (more than 8 hours per day) on any day
2. The employee number (1-indexed) who worked the most total hours in the week
3. The average working hours across all employees for the week, to 1 decimal place
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
3
7 8 9 7 8 6 5
8 8 8 8 8 8 8
6 7 8 9 10 7 6

Output:
2
2
7.6
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$employee = 3;
	$hours_1 = [7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 6, 5];
	$hours_2 = [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8];
	$hours_3 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 7, 6];

	$count = 0;

	foreach ($hours_1 as $hour) {
	    if ($hour > 8) {
	        $count++;
	        break;
	    }
	} 

	foreach ($hours_2 as $hour) {
	    if ($hour > 8) {
	        $count++;
	        break;
	    }
	} 

	foreach ($hours_3 as $hour) {
	    if ($hour > 8) {
	        $count++;
	        break;
	    }
	} 

	echo $count . "\n";

	$sum_1 = array_sum($hours_1);
	$sum_2 = array_sum($hours_2);
	$sum_3 = array_sum($hours_3);

	$max_val = max($sum_1, $sum_2, $sum_3);

	if ($max_val === $sum_1) {
	    echo 1;
	} elseif ($max_val === $sum_2) {
	    echo 2;
	} elseif ($max_val === $sum_3) {
	    echo 3;
	}

	echo $count . "\n";

	$average = ($sum_1 + $sum_2 + $sum_3) / (7 * 3);
	echo number_format($average, 1);
?>
```

### Better Code
```php
<?php
	$employees = [
	    [7, 8, 9, 7, 8, 6, 5],
	    [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8],
	    [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 7, 6]
	];

	$overtime_count = 0;
	foreach ($employees as $daily_hours) {
	    if (max($daily_hours) > 8) {
	        $overtime_count++;
	    }
	}
	echo $overtime_count . "\n";

	$weekly_totals = array_map('array_sum', $employees);
	$max_hours_employee = array_search(max($weekly_totals), $weekly_totals) + 1;
	echo $max_hours_employee . "\n";

	$total_hours = array_sum($weekly_totals);
	$total_days = count($employees) * count($employees[0]);
	echo number_format($total_hours / $total_days, 1);
?>
```

### Notes
- I'm not yet comfortable with multidimensional arrays and higher-order functions. I'd like to understand each line of processing step by step and become able to translate the required logic into code.
- I find it confusing to start thinking about loops straightaway, so I begin by translating the processing requirements into code first. The output matched expectations, so now I want to improve my ability to write more readable code, particularly in areas where I've repeated foreach statements and similar constructs.
