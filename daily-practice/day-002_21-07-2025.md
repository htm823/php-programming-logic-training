## Problem 1: Array Reverse
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
Photography enthusiast Mr Smith has taken N photos and wishes to arrange them in his album in reverse order from when they were taken.
The photo numbers are given in the order they were taken. Arrange them in reverse order and output them separated by spaces.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
5 4 3 2 1
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 5;
	$photos = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

	$photos_reverse = array_reverse($photos);

	$sorted_photos = implode(' ', $photos_reverse);

	echo $sorted_photos;
?>
```

### Notes
- I understood how to use `array_reverse()`. I got confused between `implode()` and `explode()` functions. I learnt that `implode()` is used when converting arrays into strings.

## Problem 2: Array Search
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
Librarian Miss Johnson has a list of N book reference numbers and needs to find a specific book with reference number X.
The book reference numbers are given, followed by the reference number X she's looking for.
Work out how many copies of that book are in the collection.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
6 205
101 205 103 205 104 205

Output:
3
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	list($n, $x) = [6, 205];
	$collection = [101, 205, 103, 205, 104, 205];

	$count = 0;
	foreach ($collection as $book) {
	    if ($book === $x) {
	        $count++;
	    }
	}

	echo $count;
?>
```

### Notes
- I made a mistake initially because I used `array_search()`. `array_search()` only returns the first element that matches the needle value. Instead, I should count elements using a loop and if-statement.

## Problem 3: Array Sort with Min/Max
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
At a tennis tournament, N players have completed their matches. Each player's score is given.
The tournament organiser needs to arrange the scores from lowest to highest, then announce both the lowest and highest scores.
Sort the scores in ascending order and output the lowest and highest scores separated by a space.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5
75 92 68 88 95

Output:
68 95
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 5;
	$scores = [75, 92, 68, 88, 95];

	sort($scores);

	$max_score = max($scores);
	$min_score = min($scores);

	echo $min_score . ' ' . $max_score;
?>
```

### Better Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 5;
	$scores = [75, 92, 68, 88, 95];
	
	sort($scores);
	
	$min_score = $scores[0];
	$max_score = $scores[$n - 1];
	
	echo $min_score . ' ' . $max_score;
?>
```

### Notes
- I got the correct output using `max()` and `min()`, but I learnt that `$min = $array[0]` and `$max = $array[count($array) - 1]` are more appropriate in this case because the array should be sorted and other values (like the median) might be needed as well.

## üìù Daily Notes
- **Key insight**:
	- `implode()`/`explode()`: Array-string conversion clarity
	- `array_search()`/loops: Search vs count distinction
	- `max()`/`min()`/indexing: Context-driven method selection
	- sorting: Requirement-based approach changes
- **Next focus**: strings, conditionals, edge-cases, multidimentional-arrrays
