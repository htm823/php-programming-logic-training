# Daily Practice Log

This folder contains daily learning records with problem descriptions, PHP code solutions, and learnt concepts all in one place for efficient documentation.

## 📋 Purpose
- Document daily problem-solving sessions with complete learning records
- Track progress and understanding levels
- Record PHP code solutions and new concepts learnt
- Maintain consistent learning habits with streamlined documentation

## 📝 File Content Structure
Each daily file includes:

### 📊 Summary Section
- Problems solved independently count
- Overall understanding percentage
- Main topic focus for the day

### 🧩 Three Problems with Complete Details
Each problem contains:
- Problem description and input/output format
- PHP code solution written
- Understanding percentage for each problem
- Notes on what was learnt or difficulties encountered

### 🔧 Functions & Concepts Learnt
- New PHP functions discovered during practice
- Processing patterns and their usage
- Key insights and takeaways from the session

### 📝 Daily Reflection
- Main insights from the day's practice
- Tomorrow's focus areas
- Overall session notes

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy
This streamlined approach focuses on **efficient documentation** and **comprehensive learning capture**:

- **All-in-one recording**: Combine problem-solving and concept learning in single files
- **Time-efficient**: Reduce documentation overhead whilst maintaining thoroughness
- **Immediate capture**: Record new concepts immediately within problem context
- **Maintain consistency**: Prioritise daily practice with minimal administrative burden

## 📈 Knowledge Building Strategy
1. **Solve and document** problems with immediate context capture
2. **Record functions** and patterns as they are encountered
3. **Connect concepts** within the same day's learning session
4. **Build knowledge** incrementally through daily comprehensive records
5. **Review patterns** across daily files to reinforce learning
