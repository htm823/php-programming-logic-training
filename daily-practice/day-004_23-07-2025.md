## Problem 1: Array Unique Count
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A warehouse manager needs to count how many different product types are in stock.
N products are recorded with their product IDs, but some products appear multiple times in the list.
Work out how many unique product types there are in the warehouse.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
8
101 102 101 103 102 104 101 103

Output:
4
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 8;
	$items = [101, 102, 101, 103, 102, 104, 101, 103];

	$unique = array_unique($items);

	$count = count($unique);

	echo $count;
?>
```

### Notes
- I initially learnt how to use `array_unique()` for this problem. Since I wasn't familiar with this function, I couldn't solve the question at first. However, I was already familiar with `array_count_values()` and was curious as to whether this function could also be used to solve the same problem.

## Problem 2: Array Statistics
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A sales manager needs to analyse weekly sales figures for a report.
Sales data for N days is given. Calculate the average sales and determine how many days had sales above the average. Output the number of above-average days.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5
1200 1500 900 1800 1100

Output:
2
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 5;
	$sales = [1200, 1500, 900, 1800, 1100];

	$sum = array_sum($sales);
	$length = count($sales);
	$average = $sum / $length;

	$count = 0;

	foreach ($sales as $sale) {
	    if ($sale > $average) {
	        $count++;
	    }
	}

	echo $count;
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt how to calculate the median. Initially, I used `array_sum()` to find the total of all the array's values. Then, I divided this sum by the length of the array.

## Problem 3: Sorted Array Analysis
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A sports competition organiser needs to process the final rankings.
N participants' scores are given. Sort the scores in descending order (highest first), then output:

1. The top 3 scores separated by spaces
2. On the next line, output the median score

If there are fewer than 3 participants, output all available scores. For median calculation with even numbers, output the average of the two middle values to 1 decimal place.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5
85 92 78 96 88

Output:
96 92 88
88.0
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 5;
	$scores = [85, 92, 78, 96, 88];

	rsort($scores);

	$three_scores = array_slice($scores, 0, 3);

	foreach ($three_scores as $score) {
	    echo $score . ' ';
	}

	echo "\n";

	$length = count($scores);

	$divided = $length / 2;

	if ($length % 2 === 0) {
	    $mid_right = $scores[intval($divided)];
	    $mid_left = $scores[intval($divided / 2) - 1];
	    $middle = intval(($mid_left + $mid_right) / 2);
	} else {
	    $middle = $divided;
	}

	$formatted_middle_val = number_format($scores[$middle], 1);

	echo $formatted_middle_val;
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt that `rsort()` cannot be assigned to a variable because it passes by reference. I also revised how to find the median of an array. For an odd number of elements, the array length divided by 2 gives the index of the median value. For an even number of elements, the median is calculated by adding the two middle values and dividing by 2.
