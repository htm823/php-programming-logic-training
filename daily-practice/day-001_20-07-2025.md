## Problem 1: Range Filtering
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A school nurse has conducted weight measurements for N pupils. Each pupil's weight (in kg) is given.
With a minimum weight of A kg and maximum weight of B kg, work out how many pupils have "standard weight" (between A and B inclusive)
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
6 45 60
42 50 38 55 65 48

Output:
3
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	list($n, $a, $b) = [6, 45, 65];
	$weights = [42 50 38 55 65 48];
	$count = 0;
	foreach ($weights as $weight) {
		if ($weight >= $a && $weight <= $b) {
			$count++;
		}
	}
	echo $count;
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt when to use `list()`. Initially, I assigned each value to separate variables, but I realised that `list()` makes the code much tidier.

## Problem 2: Cumulative Sum
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
Primary school pupil Hanako puts her pocket money into a piggy bank every day.
The amount of money saved for N days is given. To check how the piggy bank grows,
output the cumulative amount (total amount up to each day) separated by spaces.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
4
100 50 200 30

Output:
100 150 350 380
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
list($n, $savings) = [4, array(100, 50, 200, 30)];
$total = 0;

foreach ($savings as $saving) {
    $total += $saving;
    $cumulative[] = $total; 
}

$result = implode(' ', $cumulative);
echo $result;
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt that arrays can be used with `list()`.
- `$cumulative = []` and `array_push($cumulative, $total)` are alternatives to `$cumulative[] = $total;`

## Problem 3: Conditional Count and Sum
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
Grandfather wishes to give Christmas money to N grandchildren. The amount each grandchild is meant to receive is given.
Since grandfather's wallet has a limit, he cannot give amounts exceeding budget M.
Work out the number of grandchildren who receive M or less, and the total amount those grandchildren receive, separated by a space.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5 1000
500 1200 800 300 1500

Output:
3 1600
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
list($n, $m) = [5, 1000];
$amounts = [500, 1200, 800, 300, 1500];

$count = 0;

foreach ($amounts as $amount) {
    if ($amount < $m) {
        $count++;
        $totals[] = $amount;
    }
}

$total = array_sum($totals);
echo $count . ' ' . $total;
?>
```

### Notes
- I had no idea what process to follow at first, but once I understood which steps were needed, I managed to solve this problem.
- I learnt when to use `array_sum()` and how to implement cumulative calculation.
