## Problem 1: Basic Array Statistics
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A teacher needs to analyse test scores for a class report.
Given N students' scores, calculate:

- The highest score
- The lowest score
- The number of students who scored 80 or above
- Output these three values separated by spaces.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5
75 92 68 85 79

Output:
92 68 2
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	// Read number of students
    $student = 5;

	// Read test scores into array
    $scores = [75, 92, 68, 85, 79];
    
	// Find maximum score
    $highest_score = max($scores);
    
	// Find minimum score
    $lowest_score = min($scores);
    
	// Count students scoring 80+
    $count = 0;
    for ($i = 0; $i < $student; $i++) {
        $score = $scores[$i];
        
		// Check each score against 80
        if ($score >= 80) {
			// Increment counter if qualifying
            $count++;
        }
    }

    // Output max, min, and count with spaces
    echo $highest_score . ' ' . $lowest_score . ' ' . $count;
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt that writing out each required step as a comment first makes it much easier to extract the necessary logic from the problem statement and translate it into code.

## Problem 2: Simple Product Filtering
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
An online shop needs to filter products by price range.
Given N products with their prices, and a maximum budget, find all products within budget.
Sort these affordable products by price in ascending order and output their prices separated by spaces.
If no products are affordable, output "NONE".
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5 1000
1200 800 1500 600 900

Output:
600 800 900
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	// Read product count n
    $item_amount = 5;

	// Read budget limit
    $budget = 1000;

	// Read prices into array
    $prices = [1200, 800, 1500, 600, 900];
    
	// Filter products within budget
	// Apply array_filter for budget filtering
	// Store affordable products in new array
    $affordable_prices = array_filter($prices, function($price) use ($budget) {
        return $price <= $budget;
    });
    
	// Sort prices ascending
    sort($affordable_prices);
    
    if (!empty($affordable_prices)) {
        foreach ($affordable_prices as $price) {
			// Output space-separated prices
            echo $price . ' ';
        }
    } else {
		// Output NONE if no affordable products
        echo 'NONE';
    }
?>
```

### Alternative
```php
<?php
    $item_amount = 5;
    $budget = 1000;
    $prices = [1200, 800, 1500, 600, 900];
    
    $affordable_prices = [];
    foreach ($prices as $price) {
        if ($price <= $budget) {
            $affordable_prices[] = $price;
        }
    }
    
    sort($affordable_prices);
    
    if (!empty($affordable_prices)) {
        foreach ($affordable_prices as $price) {
            echo $price . ' ';
        }
    } else {
        echo 'NONE';
    }	
?>
```

### Better Code
```php
<?php
	$item_amount = 5;
	$budget = 1000;
	$prices = [1200, 800, 1500, 600, 900];

	$affordable_prices = array_filter($prices, function($price) use ($budget) {
	    return $price <= $budget;
	});

	sort($affordable_prices);

	if (!empty($affordable_prices)) {
		// More concisely
	    echo implode(' ', $affordable_prices);
	} else {
	    echo 'NONE';
	}
?>
```

#### Alternative
```php
<?php
	$item_amount = 5;
	$budget = 1000;
	$prices = [1200, 800, 1500, 600, 900];

	$affordable_prices = [];
	foreach ($prices as $price) {
	    if ($price <= $budget) {
	        $affordable_prices[] = $price;
	    }
	}

	sort($affordable_prices);

	if (!empty($affordable_prices)) {
		// More concisely
	    echo implode(' ', $affordable_prices);
	} else {
	    echo 'NONE';
	}	
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt that whilst `foreach` is easier to read, `array_filter()` is more appropriate in this case based on the semantic meaning. Moreover, using `implode()` is more concise than `echo $price . ' '` when outputting results separated by spaces. I now clearly understand that `sort()` is ascending whilst `rsort()` is descending.

## Problem 3: Student Average and Ranking
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A school needs to process student exam results for academic reporting.
Given N students with their names and scores, perform the following analysis:

- Calculate the class average score
- Find all students who scored above the class average
- Sort these high-achieving students by their scores in descending order
- Output the names of these students separated by spaces, or "NONE" if no students scored above average
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5
Alice 85
Bob 72
Charlie 91
Diana 88
Eve 76

Output:
Charlie Diana Alice
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	// Read student count n
    $student = 5;
    
	// Parse names and scores into associative array
    $scores = [
        "Alice"   => 85,
        "Bob"     => 72,
        "Charlie" => 91,
        "Diana"   => 88,
        "Eve"     => 76,
    ];
    
	// Compute class average
	// Sum all scores
    $sum = array_sum($scores);

	// Divide by student count
    $average = intval($sum / $student);
    
	// Filter students above average using array_filter()
	// Store qualifying students and scores in new array
    $over_average = array_filter($scores, function($score) use ($average) {
        return $score > $average;
    });
    

    if (!empty($over_average)) {
		// Sort descending by score (arsort())
        arsort($over_average);
        
        foreach ($over_average as $name => $score) {
			// Output names space-separated
            echo $name . ' ';
        }
    } else {
		// Output NONE if no qualifying students
        echo "NONE";
    }
?>
```

### Better Code
```php
<?php
	$student_count = 5;

	$students = [
	    "Alice"   => 85,
	    "Bob"     => 72,
	    "Charlie" => 91,
	    "Diana"   => 88,
	    "Eve"     => 76,
	];

	$average = array_sum($students) / count($students);

	$above_average_students = array_filter($students, function($score) use ($average) {
	    return $score > $average;
	});

	if (!empty($above_average_students)) {
	
	    arsort($above_average_students);
	
	    // Output student names separated by spaces
	    echo implode(' ', array_keys($above_average_students));
	} else {
	    echo "NONE";
	}
?>
```

### Notes
- I discovered several key concepts: `implode()` eliminates trailing whitespace issues when outputting space-delimited results; `arsort()` enables descending sort operations on associative arrays whilst maintaining key-value relationships; statistical calculations like averages benefit from preserving floating-point precision rather than using `intval()` conversion; and adopting meaningful English variable naming conventions significantly enhances code maintainability.
