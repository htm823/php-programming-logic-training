## Problem 1: String Length Check
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A website requires users to create passwords. The system needs to check password strength based on length.
A password is given as a string. If the password is 8 characters or longer, output "strong".
If it's less than 8 characters, output "weak".
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
programming

Output:
strong
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$password = "programming";
	$length = mb_strlen($password);

	if ($password >= 8) {
	    echo "strong";
	} else {
	    echo "weak";
	}
?>
```

### Better Code
```php
<?php
	$password = "programming";
	$length = strlen($password);

	if ($password >= 8) {
	    echo "strong";
	} else {
	    echo "weak";
	}
?>
```

### Notes
- I wasn't sure whether to use `mb_strlen()` or `strlen()` for password validation. I learnt that `mb_strlen()` counts characters (useful for multibyte characters like Japanese), whilst `strlen()` counts bytes. For password strength checking, `strlen()` is more appropriate as passwords typically use ASCII characters and security standards often rely on byte length.

## Problem 2: String Substring
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A company uses employee ID codes where the department code is embedded within the full ID.
An employee ID string and two integers (start position and length) are given.
Extract the department code from the specified position and output it.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
EMP2024HR001
7 2

Output:
HR
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$id = 'EMP2024HR001';
	list($start, $count) = [7, 2];

	$department = mb_substr($id, $start, $count);

	echo $department;
?>
```

### Notes
- I discovered when to use `substr()` versus `mb_substr()`. For system codes like employee IDs, `substr()` is appropriate as it works with fixed byte positions. `mb_substr()` becomes necessary when handling multibyte characters in user-facing text.

## Problem 3: Grade Classification
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A school needs to classify students' exam results into grade categories.
N students' scores are given. Classify each score according to these criteria:

- 90 or above: "A"
- 80-89: "B"
- 70-79: "C"
- Below 70: "D"

Count how many students received each grade and output the counts in the order A, B, C, D separated by spaces.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
6
95 72 85 68 91 77

Output:
2 1 2 1
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 6;
	$scores = [95, 72, 85, 68, 91, 77];

	$a = 0;
	$b = 0;
	$c = 0;
	$d = 0;

	for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) {
	    $score = $scores[$i];
	    if ($score >= 90) {
	        $a++;
	    } elseif ($score >= 80 && $score < 89) {
	        $b++;
	    } elseif ($score >= 70 && $score < 79) {
	        $c++;
	    } else {
	        $d++;
	    }
	}

	echo $a . ' ' . $b . ' ' . $c . ' ' . $d;
?>
```

### Better Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 6;
	$scores = [95, 72, 85, 68, 91, 77];

	$a = 0;
	$b = 0;
	$c = 0;
	$d = 0;

	for ($i = 0; $i < $n; $i++) {
	    $score = $scores[$i];
	    if ($score >= 90) {
	        $a++;
	    } elseif ($score >= 80) {
	        $b++;
	    } elseif ($score >= 70 && $score < 79) {
	        $c++;
	    } else {
	        $d++;
	    }
	}

	echo $a . ' ' . $b . ' ' . $c . ' ' . $d;
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt that cascading if-statements work more efficiently when arranged from highest to lowest values. This approach eliminates the need for complex range conditions, as each subsequent condition only needs to check the lower boundary.
