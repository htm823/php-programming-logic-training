## Problem 1: Inventory Management System
**Understanding**: 90%

### Problem Description
```
A shop's inventory system needs comprehensive data processing.
Given N products with their IDs and stock quantities, perform the following analysis:

1. Remove duplicate product IDs (keep the first occurrence)
2. Sort the remaining products by stock quantity in ascending order
3. Output the product ID with the lowest stock, followed by the total number of unique products
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
6
101 15
102 8
101 20
103 12
102 5
104 3

Output:
104 4
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 6;
    $data_set = [
        [101, 15],
        [102, 8],
        [101, 20],
        [103, 12],
        [102, 5],
        [104, 3]
    ];
    
    $products = [];
    
    foreach ($data_set as $data) {
        list($id, $stock) = $data;
        $products[$id] = $stock;
    }
    
    asort($products);
    
    $min_stock_id = key($products);
    
    $unique = count($products);
    
    echo $min_stock_id . ' ' . $unique;
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt that by sorting in descending order and using `key($array)`, I can retrieve the key of the smallest value. This seems like it would be quite useful in practical work.

## Problem 2: Student Grade Analytics
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A school's grade management system requires detailed student performance analysis.
N students' names and scores are given. Process the data to:

1. Calculate the class average
2. Find students scoring above average
3. Sort these high-performing students by score in descending order
4. Output their names separated by spaces, or "NONE" if no students scored above average
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5
Alice 85
Bob 72
Charlie 91
Diana 68
Eve 88

Output:
Charlie Eve Alice
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$student = 5;
    $scores  = [
        "Alice"   => 85,
        "Bob"     => 72,
        "Charlie" => 91,
        "Diana"   => 68,
        "Eve"     => 88,
    ];
    
    $sum = array_sum($scores);
    $average = intval($sum / $student);
    
    foreach ($scores as $name => $score) {
        if ($score >= $average) {
            $high_scores[$name] = $score;
        }
    }
    
    arsort($high_scores);
    
    foreach ($high_scores as $name => $score) {
        echo $name . ' ';
    }
?>
```

### Notes
- I found that using `sort()` caused the associative array keys to be lost. I learnt that `asort()` allows me to sort in ascending order whilst preserving the associative array keys.
- sort() / rsort(): keys discarded
- asort() / arsort(): keys preserved
- ksort() / krsort(): sort by keys
