## Problem 1: Inventory Management System
**Understanding**: 90%

### Problem Description
```
A shop's inventory system needs comprehensive data processing.
Given N products with their IDs and stock quantities, perform the following analysis:

1. Remove duplicate product IDs (keep the first occurrence)
2. Sort the remaining products by stock quantity in ascending order
3. Output the product ID with the lowest stock, followed by the total number of unique products
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
6
101 15
102 8
101 20
103 12
102 5
104 3

Output:
104 4
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$n = 6;
    $data_set = [
        [101, 15],
        [102, 8],
        [101, 20],
        [103, 12],
        [102, 5],
        [104, 3]
    ];
    
    $products = [];
    
    foreach ($data_set as $data) {
        list($id, $stock) = $data;
        $products[$id] = $stock;
    }
    
    asort($products);
    
    $min_stock_id = key($products);
    
    $unique = count($products);
    
    echo $min_stock_id . ' ' . $unique;
?>
```

### Notes
- I learnt that by sorting in descending order and using `key($array)`, I can retrieve the key of the smallest value. This seems like it would be quite useful in practical work.

## Problem 2: Student Grade Analytics
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A school's grade management system requires detailed student performance analysis.
N students' names and scores are given. Process the data to:

1. Calculate the class average
2. Find students scoring above average
3. Sort these high-performing students by score in descending order
4. Output their names separated by spaces, or "NONE" if no students scored above average
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
5
Alice 85
Bob 72
Charlie 91
Diana 68
Eve 88

Output:
Charlie Eve Alice
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
	$student = 5;
    $scores  = [
        "Alice"   => 85,
        "Bob"     => 72,
        "Charlie" => 91,
        "Diana"   => 68,
        "Eve"     => 88,
    ];
    
    $sum = array_sum($scores);
    $average = intval($sum / $student);
    
    foreach ($scores as $name => $score) {
        if ($score >= $average) {
            $high_scores[$name] = $score;
        }
    }
    
    arsort($high_scores);
    
    foreach ($high_scores as $name => $score) {
        echo $name . ' ';
    }
?>
```

### Notes
- I found that using `sort()` caused the associative array keys to be lost. I learnt that `asort()` allows me to sort in ascending order whilst preserving the associative array keys.
- sort() / rsort(): keys discarded
- asort() / arsort(): keys preserved
- ksort() / krsort(): sort by keys

## Problem 3: Student Score Ranking
**Understanding**: 100%

### Problem Description
```
A school needs to process student exam results for a ranking system.
Given N students' scores, perform the following analysis:

- Sort the scores in descending order (highest first)
- Calculate the average score of all students
- Count how many students scored above the average
- Output the top 3 scores separated by spaces, then on the next line output the number of above-average students

If there are fewer than 3 students, output all available scores.
```

### Input/Output Format
```
Input:
6
85 72 91 68 88 79

Output:
91 88 85
3
```

### My Code
```php
<?php
    $student = 6;
    $scores = [85, 72, 91, 68, 88, 79];
    
    
    rsort($scores);
    
    $sum = array_sum($scores);
    $average = intval($sum / $student);
    
    $count = 0;
    foreach ($scores as $score) {
        if ($score > $average) {
            $count++;
        }
    }
    
    $highest_scores = array_splice($scores, 0, 3);
    $highest_scores = implode(' ', $highest_scores);
    
    echo $highest_scores . "\n";
    echo $count;
?>
```

### Better Code
```php
<?php
    $student = 6;
    $scores = [85, 72, 91, 68, 88, 79];
    
    
    rsort($scores);
    
    $sum = array_sum($scores);
    $average = intval($sum / $student);
    
    $count = 0;
    foreach ($scores as $score) {
        if ($score > $average) {
            $count++;
        }
    }
    
	// Use array_slice() instead of array_splice() to preserve the original array
    $highest_scores = array_slice($scores, 0, 3);
    $highest_scores = implode(' ', $highest_scores);
    
    echo $highest_scores . "\n";
    echo $count;
?>
```

### Notes
- I discovered the crucial distinction between `array_splice()` and `array_slice()`. The former modifies the original array by removing elements, whilst the latter creates a new array without affecting the original. Although both would produce the same output in this particular case, `array_slice()` is the better choice because preserving the original data is essential for subsequent calculations.
